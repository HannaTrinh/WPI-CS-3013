For our project 2, we were originally working on problem 1, but on the last day we found that it was too complicated and we were not able to get it to work, so we decided to try problem 2 instead. However, because we spent so much time on problem 1, we didn't have enough time to fully debug problem 2, so we couldn't figure out why the print statements were overlapping each other.

We also had to make two copies of problem 2 because we had a segmentation fault that we couldn't figure out at first, but in the second copy, we tried splitting up the code for the two types of planes, and that solved that problem.

In order to solve problem 1 we went to office hours on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays, but for problem 2 we only went to one office hours because we started it late and didn't have the chance to go to more to figure out our problems.

The correct copy of our solution is main2.c
